# Sensorless Drive Diagnosis

In this tutorial a processing pipeline for the **Sensorless Drive Diagnosis** dataset will be used. Features are extracted from electric current drive signals. The drive has intact and defective components. This results in 11 different classes with different conditions. Each condition has been measured several times by 12 different operating conditions, this means by different speeds, load moments and load forces. The current signals are measured with a current probe and an oscilloscope on two phases.
